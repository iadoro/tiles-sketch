we use basetiles to create a graphic
we then use isolated rotations and transofmrations and the image() functino to transofmr the basetile into the position and rotaiton that we want

how do we isolate the images to another object that we can control

we need to be able to add other stuff to the canvas, and be able to control where that stuff is relative to the grid

the tiles are controlled by the canvas width and height

just making the canvas bigger (wider) and ading elements to the side -- that won't wprl currently

we just need to separate the size of the grid from the size of the canvas

make it not use canvas variables, use other variables for height and width

and then we can make the canvas bigger, have extra space and elements to the side
